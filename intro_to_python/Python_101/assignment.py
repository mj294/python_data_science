    Given a sentence, give the most common letter for each word.
    You should lowercase the letters. If there's a tie, include any of them.
    example:
    INPUT: "Welcome to Zipfian Academy!"
    OUTPUT: 'e t i a'
    Hint: use Counter and the string join method
    (It is possible to do this in one line, but you might lose some
